LogDissector is an AWK script for making sense of very large logfiles.

It creates a bunch of other files from the data it collects as it passes over the logfile.

Make sure you have sufficient disk space before running it.

LogDissector was written both to showcase the power of AWK's associative arrays, and as a tool for daily use in systems administration.
