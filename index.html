        <h3>So what's this about?</h3>

I realized logfiles have a variety of line formats, but a bunch of common elements.

Recognizing the common elements, and replacing them with indicators of what they are - an IP address, filename, date, etc. - generates a "pattern" - something which will be repeated N times in a logfile.

This script passes over a logfile once.  It adds entries in various associative arrays for all the elements it finds, whether they be just words, or something recognizable as some other kind of element.  It also associates the line number with the pattern for the line.  Various counters get bumped up as well.

Once all of the lines have been parsed, the "post processing" phase begins.

It's pretty simple - loop over every associative array we've created, and print it out, but print it to a "command pipe" which sorts the resulting output.

<h3>End result</h3>

This script creates a bunch of new files.  They're all worth reviewing.  Often you'll be able to extract insights from them that you very well may have missed by simply reviewing the logfile itself.
